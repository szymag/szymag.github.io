      <description>The end of may is quite busy for me. I have to finish some projects on my University before the end of month, to be sure that I will able to spend enough time on GSoC. Everything is on track, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to worry.
At the weekend I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend time on looking into SymPy, especially into diffgeom module. I would like to find some idea, witch could be use in my project.</description>
